    IBL aims to understand the neural basis of decision-making in the mouse by gathering a whole-brain activity map composed of electrophysiological recordings pooled from multiple laboratories. We have systematically recorded from nearly all major brain areas with Neuropixels probes, using a grid system for unbiased sampling and replicating each recording site in at least two laboratories. These data have been used to construct a brain-wide map of activity at single-spike cellular resolution during a decision-making task. In addition to the map, this data set contains other information gathered during the task: sensory stimuli presented to the mouse; mouse decisions and response times; and mouse pose information from video recordings and DeepLabCut analysis.

Subject:
  description: |
    Mice were housed under a 12/12 h light/dark cycle (normal or inverted depending on the laboratory) with food and water 112 available ad libitum, except during behavioural training days. Electrophysiological recordings and behavioural training were performed during either the dark or light phase of the subject cycle depending on the laboratory. Subjects were obtained from either the Jackson Laboratory or Charles River.
  strain: C57BL/6
